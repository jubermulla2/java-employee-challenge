 * EmployeeDao is a placeholder class for data access operations related to employee data.

 * operations, queries, and database interactions related to employee entities.
 *
 * For now, mock APIs are being used to simulate the data access layer. This class will
 * be expanded with actual database logic once the DB connection is established.
